# Dojo Example

This example demonstrates the use of `dojo/domReady!`, `dojo/router` and `dojo/topic` in combination with the SDK to generate/configure events as customers use your Dojo application.

## Demonstration

To see the example in action serve index.html.  You will need to build the SDK first using webpack.  See the main README.md for more information.
